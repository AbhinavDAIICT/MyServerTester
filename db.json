    "body": "<p>We’ve all been there: struggling to find the right word, drawing a blank, and ultimately settling for a subpar synonym. (It’s like having to describe the best meal you’ve ever had as “good” rather than “mouthwatering” or “delectable”; it just doesn’t do the food justice.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It’s pretty obvious that a larger vocabulary can help prevent these frustrating situations, allowing us to choose words witha greater precision. But what’s less obvious are the ways that a larger vocabulary can help us outside of reading and writing.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Big Benefits</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>A great example of one of the lesser-known benefits of a large vocabulary comes from a study of children.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That study examined a group of children when they were 18 months old and again when they were 24 months old. Researchers found that the children who heard more words when they were 18 months old knew more words and were faster in word recognition at 24 months than their counterparts who had heard fewer words.</p>\r\n<p>In other words, the more words the children heard, the more words they knew; and the more words they knew, the faster they could recognize and process information.</p>\r\n<p>OK, but what about for us as adults? Here are some big ways that boosting the brain’s word bank can help throughout our lives</p>\r\n",
